## Features
- üìö Implementation of various graph algorithms
- üß© Easy-to-understand code structure
- üìù Well-documented functions for each algorithm

## Installation
There is no specific installation process required for this project. Simply clone the repository to your local machine to access the source code.

## Usage
To use the algorithms provided in this project, you can directly incorporate the relevant code into your own projects or run the existing code for demonstration and testing purposes.

## Example
```python
# Example of using Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph

from algorithms import dijkstra

graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}

shortest_path = dijkstra(graph, 'A', 'D')
print(shortest_path)
```
